This repository's purpose is to document the work performed by Professor Nicola Bezzo's capstone team.

The capstone team created a method of unsupervised surface classification, which was used to adapt the control
performance of a UGV. This work was performed over the 2017/2018 academic year at the University of Virginia.

In this repository, one will find the code developed and Rosbag data recorded for the project. The Wiki provides
information on how to operate these files, and further descriptions of the work performed.
